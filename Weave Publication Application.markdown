## Institutional Information

Matthew Reidsma and Kyle Felker of Grand Valley State University, and Pete Coco of Wheaton College (Massachusetts), are the editors of Weave: Journal of Library User Experience (http://weaveux.org).

## Project Goals & Audience

Weave’s primary purpose is to provide a forum where practitioners of UX principles in libraries (wherever they are, whatever their job title is) can have discussions that increase and extend our understanding of UX principles and research. This is our primary aim: to improve the practice of UX in libraries, and in the process, to help libraries be better, more relevant, more useful, more humane places.

There are no publications addressing user experience in libraries, despite the fact that it is one of the fastest-growing areas of interest within the field. Since it affects in-person experiences as well as online interactions, UX is part of the fabric of our work with patrons. No publication has yet made a place for rigorous practical and theoretical discussions on the way we interact with our patrons.

While we focus on library UX, there is a lot of important work in the field happening outside librarianship. The Editorial Board feels strongly that Weave should be library-focused, but not library-centric, and that the editors should consider submissions that are not explicitly about libraries as long as there is some potential linkage to the journal’s primary focus.

### Readership

Weave’s intended primary audience consists of people in librarianship who are using or are interested in using UX principles or research techniques. That means not only people whose job title or primary areas of responsibility are UX-related, but anyone at all who has an interest or stake in improving library experience for users, and that should include everyone who works in a library, from administrators to instruction librarians to catalogers.

Important conversations about UX can take a variety of forms, and the traditional peer reviewed article is only one of them.  Weave does publish research material, for which we use a traditional double-blind peer review process. But the editors also publish non-scholarly pieces in a variety of formats.

## Content

Weave has yet to put out a call for papers, although we are ready to do so. We hope to put out this CFP in late summer and publish our first issue in the spring of 2014. Our regular publication schedule will be 2 issues a year, in March and October. 

Weave is a digital, web-based publication. All content will be delivered to us as electronic documents, and will live electronically in publication. Because we want the journal to be web-based, we want the content to appear only as HTML.

Because we aim to be experimental in this journal, content may include embedded images or multimedia, all of which will be delivered electronically. We anticipate receiving content in Word or Rich Text (.rtf) files, and can provide high-quality PNG files for images and high-quality .MP4 and .OGV files for video.

Because we want the content to be as accessible as possible, we prefer to deliver multimedia without using proprietary software such as Flash. This may necessitate multiple versions of a single multimedia file to accommodate browser differences, but the editors of Weave will assume the responsibility of providing these files to the publisher.

We are looking for a clean, easy-to-use and legible site for this published material. The look and feel of your own *Journal of Electronic Publishing* appeals to us, in that content is well-organized, the site is clean and well-designed, and content has the appropriate scholarly 

## Editorial & Peer Review

Scholarly submissions are double-blind peer-reviewed. Our review editor, Kyle Felker, will send newly submitted research articles to reviewers based on their areas of expertise as well as availability. Reviewers will have 21 days to review the article and submit a decision on whether the article is appropriate for Weave and meets our criteria (more on that below). On occasion, members of the editorial board could also serve as peer-reviewers if the piece was a good fit for their expertise.

Non-scholarly content works a little differently. Pete Coco, the Dialog Box editor, is looking for pitches for this review section, and will work with interested writers to develop and revise their work until it is ready to be published. 

In both cases, we may sometimes solicit articles from certain individuals or on specific topics. Scholarly work would still go through the traditional double-blind peer review process.

Once a piece is ready for publication, the editors and a few volunteers from the editorial board will help get the article ready for publication by making any stylistic suggestions they feel might make the piece more readable and copyediting the work and making sure it matches the house style (currently APA version 6).

### Editorial Board

Our editorial board includes internationally-recognized experts in the field of library user experience:

* Suzanne Chapman, Head of UX, University of Michigan Libraries
* Amanda Etches, Head of Access & Discovery, University of Guelph Libraries
* Courtney Greene, Head of Digital UX, University of Indiana Libraries
* Josh Hadro, Executive Editor, Library Journal
* Cody Hanson, Acting Director of Web Development, University of Minnesota Libraries
* Alison Prince, Web Manger, Bodleian Libraries, Oxford University
* Aaron Schmidt, Principal, Influx Library User Experience

### Peer-Review

We have already recruited over 20 peer reviewers from throughout the profession, and continue to look to expand the network. We looked for applicants with library experience who were able to connect their work with UX principles or research, and gave priority to those who had made a contribution to the discipline. This has given us a diverse pool of reviewers with expertise ranging from digital user interface design to traditional reference librarianship. A list of peer reviewers is available if you wish to review it.

The editorial board is interested in publishing both theoretical and practical scholarship. Practitioners need to constantly re-examine the role, principles, and practice of UX in libraries.   We want discussions of specific techniques and how to do them, but we also want to see discussions of why we are doing what we are doing and debates on the best way to do it. We are interested in publishing work that explores new areas of UX in libraries and we value clarity of writing.

On the other hand, Weave also looks to publish non-scholarly material. Starting with the familiar format of the book review, we are looking for UX practitioners to engage a variety of artifacts&#8212;not just books&#8212; in dialogs relevant to UX. This content will not be held to the same scholarly standard, and will be reviewed by the Dialog Box editor, Pete Coco, or other members of the editorial board[TK?].

That said, we also aim to be experimental. User Experience as a field is relatively new, and this journal is very, very new.  Because of that, aside from our guiding principles [Link to vision document] and the rules that govern the actual editorial and peer-review process, we try not to have too many rules and strictures. We try things.  Sometimes they work, sometimes they don’t. Those of us involved in creating and running Weave would like to take some risks with this journal, and try some things that might be unorthodox.  

## Financing & Support

Weave is an Open Access journal, available free of charge. We believe strongly that access to scholarly information is a user experience issue. The impediments to information seeking, retrieval, and use posed by restrictive licensing and misuse of copyright are among the greatest challenges libraries today. While we have no financial support, we have dedicated editors, an involved editorial board, and a growing group of peer-reviewers who are volunteering their time to make this journal a success.
